The global RNAi drugs market size was valued at USD 91.49 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow from USD 114.2 billion in 2025 to USD 381.03 billion by 2031, expanding at a remarkable CAGR of 23.2% during the forecast period.

RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics represent a revolutionary class of precision medicines that leverage the body’s natural gene-silencing pathways. By using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA), RNAi drugs degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules to suppress disease-causing genes. This mechanism enables targeted treatment of genetic disorders, viral infections, and cancers at the molecular level, marking a major advancement in modern healthcare.
