Diosmectite, a naturally occurring aluminosilicate clay, is widely recognized for its therapeutic role in diarrhea management and related gastrointestinal conditions. Its unique layered structure offers strong adsorption properties, enabling it to bind pathogens, toxins, and excess fluids in the digestive tract. Available in both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) formulations, diosmectite is gaining traction in both developed and emerging healthcare markets.
